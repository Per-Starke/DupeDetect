Da die Koordinate 4711 auf recht einfachem Weg zu erreichen ist, gibt es hierzu auch keine weiteren Details.
Wichtig ist vielleicht zu wissen, Querfeldein ist nicht, es sei denn Ihr seid die totalen Superhelden, also immer schön auf den gekennzeichneten Wegen bleiben.</groundspeak:long_description>

Danke für den Cache und die tolle Aussicht.

Auf dem Rückweg haben wir uns arg verlaufen und sind (statt ins Tal zu gehen) noch jede Menge Höhenmeter zur Edelweiß-Hütte gelaufen... haben geschwitzt wie die Rochen, aber trotzdem gut gelaunt...

Out: Coin (NRW 2008), die scheinbar ganz frisch hier gelandet ist...

birth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="blue"&gt;The poem To a
Mountain Daisy appeared in the Kilmarnock Volume, Robert Burns
first published book in 1786. Much of his fame today still rests on
the poems which appeared in that volume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Burns was one of the most charismatic people ever to have
walked on this earth. Yet even today, 250 years after his birth, he
is misunderstood by many.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Burns was a complex individual. We can look at different
aspects of his character almost as if we were looking at the facets
of a diamond. Each facet has a clarity, a depth and a
brilliance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=

height="498" width="450" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="blue"&gt;Firstly there is
Burns the poet.&lt;br /&gt;
It was his poems which initially assured him of a worldwide stage.
Poems that are full of fun. Poems that champion the poor and
oppressed. Satires against the hypocrisy and cant of the
Calvinistic church. Philosophies and observations of life and its
people. His concern for human rights and his love of friendship.
His poems can pierce your soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Burns the songwriter.&lt;br /&gt;
It was into his songs that Burns' consummate literary craftsmanship
breathed a rejuvenating life and spirit, and a consistently
all-pervading honesty and sincerity. Burns rescued over 370 songs
from obscurity and neglect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Burns the letter writer.&lt;br /&gt;
His correspondents included the Prime Minister, clergymen, doctors,
lawyers and the cream of literary society of his day. He immersed
himself in the affairs of the time, political and social, writing
to John Francis Erskine,the 27th Earl of Mar as follows: 'Does any
man tell me, that my feeble efforts can be of no service; that it
does not belong to my humble station to meddle with the concerns of
a People? - I tell him, that it is on such individuals as I, that
for the hand of support and the eye of intelligence, a Nation has
to rest.'&lt;br /&gt;
At that time only the wealthy had a vote, and yet Burns, one of the
greatest intellects to walk the world's stage, who mingled at ease
in conversation with the aristocracy, had no vote.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Burns the patriot and politician.&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Burns was quintessentially Scottish. Almost everything he
did was political. His writing of songs was done for no
remuneration. He knew that a nation without song had no soul. He
knew that a nation without song would lose its identity. He kept
alive the idea that there was such a thing as a Scottish nation. He
helped to keep our belief in ourselves breathing through a long,
long hibernation. The truth is that Scotland would have a different
identity, if it had not been for Robert Burns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Burns was universal and a humanitarian.&lt;br /&gt;
He was able to take everyday events, as in To a Mouse or Mountain
Daisy, for example, and turn them into universal truths. His poetry
speaks of breaking down international barriers, of championing
human rights, and standing up and being a voice for oppressed
people throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If A Man&amp;rsquo;s a Man is the Anthem to humanity then Auld Lang
Syne is the world&amp;rsquo;s National Anthem, an anthem of
friendship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is Immortal.&lt;br /&gt;

for splashing water!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A colorful array of 26 flags has flown over the breakwater since
1978, largely &lt;br /&gt;
through the efforts of the non-profit Flag Project founded by Paul
Mills and &lt;br /&gt;
dedicated to locating sponsors, raising funds and maintaining the
flags and &lt;br /&gt;
their supporting flagpoles. Paul Mills passed away in September
2004 and &lt;br /&gt;
the flags were ultimately taken down due to their worn condition.
But after &lt;br /&gt;
nearly a three-year hiatus, the flag display was officially
restored to the &lt;br /&gt;
breakwater in August 2007. &lt;br /&gt;
 The current breakwater flag display is a joint effort of the Yacht
Club and &lt;br /&gt;
Waterfront Department. The Waterfront Department maintains the
flagpoles &lt;br /&gt;
and rigging, and recently added solar lighting to the American flag
to properly &lt;br /&gt;
illuminate it at night. The Yacht Club maintains the flags, raising
and &lt;br /&gt;
lowering them and locating sponsors to pay for them. The flags fly
&lt;br /&gt;
Wednesday through Sunday, weather permitting. &lt;br /&gt;

The Santa Barbara Maritime Museum is nearby. The museum's structure was formerly known as the Old Naval Reserve Center and was built by the Federal Government's Works Project Administration (WPA) program during the late 1930s through early 1940s.

The Harbor began almost a hundred years ago when a wealthy Santa Barbara resident wanted to keep his yacht closer to home - or so the story goes.  He created the breakwater and harbor that keeps the considerable fishing and pleasure boat population of Santa Barbara safe and moored. 

We like Brophy Brothers, a great local restaurant with views of the harbor and mountains. Sitting at the bar enjoying the view is a local favorite.

work. Next door you will be able to see the side wall of the Salt

that is now a rather pricey restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">As the fire organization grew and priorities were established, the Henry Miller Library and the Big Sur Inn (Deetjen's), listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior, became the focus of my Strike Team's efforts.  We spent a week at these locations, successfully diverting the fire and saving the properties.  Our host was extremely gracious and offered both food and shelter during the early stages of the fight when the organization had limited provisions.  This cache will place you in the vacinity of Castro Canyon off of Highway 1.  Take the time to explore the beauty and soak up the history of the area.  There are safe areas to pull off the highway but please be aware of the traffic.</groundspeak:long_description>

This residence sits on a 20 by 20 square foot lot in the heart of Old Town Santa Barbara. Constructed exclusively of poured concrete it consists of 800,000 pounds of concrete and 4 1/4 miles or rebar rising 53 feet above ground level and sitting on nine caissons extending 44 feet into the ground. The interior consists of award winning tile designs, a 108 foot long black walnut hand rail, key-hole window designs, multiple stone carvings and more representing the work of six local artists. The house is a must see and is open on occasion for public tours.

This odd lot is tucked away behind the shops lining State street. The house is located at back of the public alley on the right side. I have placed the cache down this alley. It is a "tube" container painted to match the surroundings, and located in plain sight. 
PLEASE replace in the same spot you find it! Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Today, West Cabrillo Boulevard is home to several modest tourist hotels, but 100 years age this stretch of road was home to one of the fanciest hotels on the west coast: the Potter Hotel.

Anticipating the arrival of tourists as the coastal rail line was completed to San Francisco in 1902, the luxurious 600-room Potter Hotel opened on the block between Bath and Chapala. Many wealthy tourists came to Santa Barbara, some of whom stayed and purchased local estates. Guests such as the Carnegies, Rockefellers, Armours, Vanderbilts, Du Ponts, Studebakers, and Fleischmanns ate in the resort's dining room. Supplies for the kitchen came from the hotel's own farm and dairy.  Unfortunately, on April 13, 1921, an arson fire destroyed the grand hotel. The site of the hotel is now Ambassador Park, just a few buildings west from the cache location.

I guess this isn't so much a lamp post skirt hide as it is a "full length dress" hide. This may be a bit harder than your typical LPS. This one's a nano. It's painted green, by the way.

the most popular convention centers in the world, a variety of

It is also home to several different examples of urban art. Once
there, look for a statue of a friendly guy by sculptor Terry Allen.

kayak launch sites.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located at Monastery Beach, a part Carmel River State Park. This
should be an easy find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beach is a tough one to launch from given the dumping surf
on a gruss (decomposed granite) beach. The gruss is like ball
bearings, making the slide into the sea very easy. The trouble is,
near perfect timing is required to avoid being under the wave
rather than on top of it. One premature nudge and it is all over
for the unwary kayaker. The surf here tends to hold onto you once
it has you and there is no traction on the steep beach. My buddies
and I have had some exciting moments. :)&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach is also known as Mortuary Beach to the local divers
from what I am told. The off shore area holds some spectacular
underwater scenery, but getting to it can be tough. They have to
battle the same elements I mention above, plus they are carrying
all that dive gear! Many a time I have seen divers literally
crawling out of the water and desperately clawing their way up the
beach, trying to escape the surf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had one of my most memorable wildlife encounters not far
off this beach. Check out my &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.ckayaks.org/images/Shark/" target="_blank"&gt;shark
link&lt;/a&gt; for photos of an 18-20 foot beauty that played with a
couple of us for about 15-20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the cache!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Another great micro in a high tourist area. &lt;a href="http://www.thehollywoodbowl.com"&gt;The Hollywood Bowl&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;If you are in the area, there are some things you should see in Hollywood. "&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=56610"&gt;Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;" is a long hike. "&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=53835"&gt;Passion&lt;/a&gt;" is a steep hike. This 'Hollywood Bowl' should be just right for you beginning cachers. Slight elevation change, subtle hiding spot, but nothing that a little geocaching intuition shouldn't lead you right to. 
&lt;p&gt;I'll add some hints later if it seems like this one is too hard to find. But for now, you're on your own. Think micro.
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is in a publicly accessible area, you should be able to walk right up to the cache at any hour. Even though this cache is only a stone's throw from the Bowl itself, you do not need to purchase a ticket for admission.
&lt;p&gt;We placed this one today after we found out a little known secret in Hollywood. For most of the shows that are at the Bowl at night, they have a complete dress rehearsal in the morning. Today, at 10AM we saw John Lithgow and Roger Daltrey in My Fair Lady, front row center, for free and didn't even have to pay for parking. Call the box office and ask when the 'morning rehearsals' are if you want to try this. Bonus points if you can upload a picture of you in your seat, or a view of the stage.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Union Square was named before the start of the Civil War as a
tribute to the frequent demonstrations that were held there in
support of the Union. 
&lt;p&gt;The large Corinthian column in the middle is a memorial to
Admiral Dewey's victory over the Spanish Navy during the
Spanish-American War. The column and statue was dedicated in 1903
and stayed standing through the 1906 earthquake. The face of the
bronze Victory statue was actually modeled after Mrs. Adolph de
Bretteville Spreckels, a San Francisco benefactress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Canary Island date palms fringe the park. The park is
also fringed with some of the finest shopping in San Francisco.
Here's your chance to let your non-geocaching half (if you have
one) shop, while &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; try to figure out where this classic
&lt;u&gt;magnetic&lt;/u&gt; micro is hidden. The coordinates should take you
near the base of the Dewey monument. Consider the following three
points very carefully...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not on the roof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difficulty is a significant clue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of trouble to make sure the coordinates
are correct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first point is the most important. It might help to consider
the clues while walking the perimiter of the square.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This part of San Francisco received nationwide fame in 1996 when
the David Letterman "Late Night" show was broadcast from San
Francisco. David rolled things down this hill including super
bouncy balls and watermelons
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj0uvl5kbhw). This is the steepest
drivable grade in the city. It is a 31.5% grade and it is one-way
down only. The sidewalks are so steep, they have steps. Great place
to bring visitors when driving around the city. I love the look in
their eyes when you pull up at the top and stop. Cache is magnetic.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the oldest continuous cache in San Francisco County!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
August 11, 2012 - congratulations to LadyLeo191 who is the 2,000th geocacher to log a successful find of the Green Thumb cache!!! It took just over 8 years for the first 1,000 geocachers to find it, and just over three years for the next 1,000. I don't know if that's because geocaching is catching on, or because Green Thumb is on a lot of "favorites" lists - but in any event - woot!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April 3, 2012. FOLKS! Today I took inventory. Of 27 Travel Bugs listed as being in the cache, only 3 were physically present. If you remove a TB from the cache, please take the time to log that you have it on the web site, even if you don't place it in a cache for quite a while. There are a lot of disappointed Travel Bug owners out there whose TBs have gone missing from this cache, and it's really a shame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
February 9, 2011 - coming up on 1,500 visitors!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
July 12, 2009 - Congratulations to bunkyboo, the 1000th geocacher to log the Green Thumb cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
July 19, 2009 - met with the delightful bunkyboo family to give them their swag for being 1000th to log the cache. Hopefully they'll log some photos of the "event." Prizes donated by groundspeak.com include book ("The Idiot's Guide to Geocaching") and a really neat geocoin, plus some other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
July 19, 2009 - there were only two travel bugs in the cache, and no geocoins. One of the travel bugs is listed as being at the Botanical Gardens across town, presumably someone will log it into Green Thumb eventually. The other one is "Server Crash." This cache appears to be the Bermuda Triangle of travel bugs and geocoins - they go in and are never seen again! Maybe I should set up a spycam and see why that is&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a large blue metal cylindrical bin with a lid on it, in the SW corner of a community garden plot under a 6' tall lemon tree with a wide wingspan. Please be very respectful of the other gardeners and their plots. Do not walk in any of the plots, and please do not pick any flowers or produce, or leave any litter. Having said that, this garden is situated in a National Park, on public land, and is open to the public at all times. You have every right to be there! I consider this geocache a community service and an asset to the park, and I personally welcome you to visit the community garden! Please feel free to sit there and have lunch at the picnic tables, and enjoy the surroundings. And if anybody asks, say you're a friend of Alexandra's :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you see a black and white cat, that's Midnight. He was born in the garden (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil?). If you see a black and white skunk (or several), they seem to like to hang around near my garden, so be warned! Only one geocacher has actually been "skunked" - she wrote about the experience in her log - so your odds are pretty good that you won't be skunked.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">While on a recent trip up north Leap Frog and I came upon the most beautiful park. This park is not only in our majestic Redwoods but there is also a 50 foot waterfall that cascades down to the beach below. We thought that you would have to go to the south pacific to ever see anything like this. Well believe me when I tell you that it is right here in our own back yard. Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is located along Hyw 1. This gem along the coast includes a 1,700 acre underwater reserve for experienced divers. It is here that the 50ft waterfall cascades to the sandy beach and flows into the ocean. A magnificent site that can not be missed while traveling along the Big Sur coast. All you have to do for this cache is take your picture with your GPS in it and the waterfall in the backround and include it in your log. You can only view the falls from a trail above but it really is spectacular. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

Basketball, paddle tennis, handball, weightlifting, beach activities, skateboarding, skating, running, or just walking and people watching along the famous Venice Boardwalk.  we previously lived within 75 steps from front door to the walkway, and to commemorate the occasion, we placed this right in the middle of it all!

Enjoy the side shows, the booths and everything that goes on here!  we love it!  
PLEASE PLACE THE CACHE BACK EXACTLY AS YOU FOUND IT.  THE MAGNETS ARE NOT THAT STRONG SO IT NEEDS TO BE HELPED A BIT.

It's a magnetized ALTOIDS TIN with a sheet to sign. small items ok really small, anything too big, or too many items make it slip from it's hiding place

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is just off the Byron exit of I-15. The cache container is a green ammo can. It contains the usual swag. Apparently there is a fence up, but the cache is on public land.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I can never pass this exit without thinking of my good friend Byron Thorton. He died a couple of years ago at the age of 96. He was an old sheep herder from Parowon, Utah. From age 11 years old he spent the summers alone herding sheep in the mountains above Parowon. He used to tell me stories of watching the 4th of July fireworks from the tops of the mountains and longing to be home. He moved to Las Vegas in the 1930's and lived in a tent with his new bride. He eventually built a successful propane gas business and hauled propane from California to Las Vegas in a rickety tanker truck. Sometime in the 1950's the propane tanks at his company exploded, killing his business partner, who was a relative, and his partner's wife and five children. They lived on the property of the propane company. 

Byron retired in 1953, the year I (Boris) was born. He lived in retirement for almost 50 years. Byron was as sharp as a tack until the day he died. He loved talking about the adventures of his life. And he loved singing his favorite song, the state song of Nevada, Home Means Nevada. I can still hear my good friend Byron singing these words:

Way out in the land of the setting sun,
Where the wind blows wild and free,
There's a lovely spot, just the only one
That means home sweet home to me.
If you follow the old Kit Carson trail,
Until desert meets the hills,
Oh you certainly will agree with me,
It's the place of a thousand thrills.

Home means Nevada 
Home means the hills,
Home means the sage and the pine.
Out by the Truckee, silvery rills,
Out where the sun always shines,
Here is the land which I love the best,
Fairer than all I can see.
Deep in the heart of the golden west
Home means Nevada to me.

Whenever the sun at the close of day,
Colors all the western sky,
Oh my heart returns to the desert grey
And the mountains tow'ring high.
Where the moon beams play in shadowed glen,
With the spotted fawn and doe,
All the live long night until morning light,
Is the loveliest place I know.

Home means Nevada
Home means the hills,
Home means the sage and the pines.
Out by the Truckee's silvery rills,
Out where the sun always shines,
There is the land that I love the best,
Fairer than all I can see.
Right in the heart of the golden west
Home means Nevada to me.</groundspeak:long_description>
